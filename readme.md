> Understanding the phases with "Time to ..."

1. Planning<br>
   a. Time to plan before execution😂<br>
   b. Defining goals and requirements for the project.<br>
   c. Defining the scope of work.<br>

   c. Functional - What the system does!<br>
   d. Example: Users can login, register, etc.<br>
   e. Non-functional - How the system performs!<br>

   b. In short, **_let's code!_**<br>
   c. Follow the best practices.
   d. If you are doing TDD, much better, write some unit tests too.<br><br>
5. Testing<br>
   a. Time to see what you've done!<br>
   b. Is everything working as per the test cases?<br>
   c. Perform unit, integration and end-to-end testing.<br><br>
6. Deployment<br>
   a. Time to put it live!<br>
   b. Choose the hosting solution / provider.<br>
   c. Set up the CI/CD pipeline.<br>
   d. Ensure database and backend scalability.<br><br>
